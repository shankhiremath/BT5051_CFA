# BT5051_CFA

This repository will serve as a reference for the code used in the CFA report I made as a part of the course BT5051 (Transport Phenomena in Biological Systems) offered by Prof. G. K. Suraishkumar in the independence semester of 2020 during my undergraduate studies at IIT Madras.

4 different cases of information diffusion have been studied in a 2D network in which the initial conditions and boundary conditions are different. In each case the boundary conditions are such that the initial sources of information remain as a constant source of information with maximum information density value of 100.

Results of the simulations:

Case 1:

Information interaction was modeled using the Gray-Scott Model (a reaction-diffusion system)
